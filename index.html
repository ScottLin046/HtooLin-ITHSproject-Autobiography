      <p class="left"> My full name is Htoo Aung Lin and I also have an Arabic name called Zubai. I'm currently a
        student at Information Technology High School. In order to use my technological skills and work toward my goal
        of being the most powerful individual in the world, I want to join the military after high school and attend MIT
        to study nuclear physics. I had always seen myself pursuing a career in computer science and cybersecurity up
        until my junior year of high school, but that has since shifted after I got the opportunity to work as an
        intern. It was only then that I understood I couldn't see myself doing it as a job. My decision-making process
        was aided by my awareness of my other interests. </p>

        I like to engage in physical activity when I have free time. For strength training and muscular hypertrophy, I
        often work out at the school gym and previously trained with the Marines to improve my endurance and
        cardiovascular health. I also plan to run regularly every day since I will not be training with them. But even
        with all of this, I still need to be more disciplined if I want to achieve my sole objective. Rock climbing is
        another after-school extracurricular activity I'm now involved in since it helps me train differently than I
        normally would. Additionally, I attend TechSquad occasionally and am a member of the robotics club. Even if my
        idea for the future is unheard of, I still intend to strive to make it happen. Whether I am successful or not is
        in the hand of god.
